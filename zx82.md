# ZX82 Replacement ROM for ZX Spectrum

## Introduction

In 1982, the ROM program with which the ZX Spectrum (both the 16k and the 48k versions) shipped was a proof-of-concept 
prototype, meant to be replaced as soon as the final version was ready. Alas, for various reasons it never happened.
Several subsystems in the ROM remained unfinished and quite a few bugs remained together with legacy solutions from ZX81 
which were planned to be upgraded for the more powerful machine.

This ROM attempts to be what the ZX Spectrum's final ROM could have been, should it have been finished. The Manual written 
by dr. Steve Vickers served as its primary specification. Both authors of the original ROM, dr. Steve Vickers and John Grant 
have been interviewed by email in the course of its creation. As much as possible, compatibility with existing ZX Spectrum 
software and hardware has been maintained by preserving important entry points. If you find some software or hardware that 
is not compatible with this ROM, please file an issue. I cannot promise to resolve it, but it will be certainly considered.

In addition to fixing bugs or finishing unfinished subsystems, this ROM also contains a few changes aiming at extensibility. 
These changes have been made in such a way as to not degrade performance compared with the ROM with which the ZX Spectrum 
shipped, mainly providing alternative execution paths upon error conditions.

This document describes all changes made to the ROM and is aimed at both users and developers.

## Interrupt Subsystem

### Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI)

In the original ROM, the system variable NMIADD (address `$5CB0`) is initialized to zero, causing the NMI service routine 
to reset. Any change to its value causes non-maskable interrupts to be ignored. There is plenty of evidence in the ROM and 
in the literature that this is not the intended behavior. In this ROM, NMIADD is initialized to a warm restart routine 
returning the user to the command line, if possible (acting like a stronger `BREAK`) and the service routine has been 
modified to execute it upon NMI. If NMIADD is changed to zero, it will ignore NMI events.

Authors of extension ROMs that page over this ROM are advised to copy the service routine from this ROM so that NMI behavior 
does not depend on which ROM bank happens to be paged in and upon initialization point NMIADD to a small routine 
in RAM paging in the appropriate ROM bank before jumping to the intended NMI handler.

### Maskable Interrupt (IM1)

All dependencies on the value of IY have been eliminated from the maskable frame interrupt service routine. Thus, any 
Z80 register can be safely changed while interrupts are enabled. The functionality of the IM1 service routine has not 
changed: it increments the 24-bit frame counter and reads the keyboard.

## The I/O Subsystem

### I/O Abstraction Model

The I/O abstraction with streams and channels has not been finished in the original ROM; according to Steve Vickers, the 
code in there is a plug. In this ROM, it has been extended to the point that it allows writing device drivers for 
the screen and the keyboard, allowing real or virtual terminals, pipes, completely different video hardware and many 
other interesting and useful things. This is mainly achieved through making `RST $10` call the output service routine 
with the **carry flag set**, while other functionality of the device is exposed through calling the output service 
routine with the the carry flag cleared. Such calls to the output service routine are called `IOCTL`.

By convention, `IOCTL` with register `A` holding zero resets the hardware attached to the channel. For the `S` channel,
it clears the screen, aborts stateful output sequences (such as color controls), resets the pixel pointer to the origin,
restores permanent attributes and places the caret to the top left corner. For the `K` channel, it only clears the 
console part of the screen, resets it to two rows, places the caret to the bottom left corner and aborts stateful input 
and output sequences. The `P` channel flushes the printer buffer in addition to aborting stateful output sequences.

Other `IOCTL` calls are not standardized, the same code might have a very different meaning for different 
devices. All access to abstract peripherial devices is routed through the appropriate channels' service routines.

### Keyboard Inputs

The keyboard click sound has been moved to the input service routine of the `K` channel and it thus indicates that 
a typed character has been read off the channel. `INPUT` from other channels no longer emit a click after each byte 
read. Furthermore, setting system variable `PIP` (address `$5C39`) to zero disables keyboard clicks altogether. It is 
initialized to 1.

As a side effect, switching to and from `Extended` input mode also emits a keyboard click. Prompts such as `scroll?` or 
`Start tape, then press any key...` no longer crash upon pressing mode keys, but also respond with an audible click to 
any keypress. If you wish to record tape audio without these clicks, zero `PIP` first.

### Control Characters

As one can expect reading the manual, cursor movement controls `CHR$ 8` through `CHR$ 11` move the caret, if sent to
`S` or `K` channels. `CHR$ 12` (ASCII form feed) clears the screen.

`CHR$ 14` and `CHR$ 15` indicate that the next character is a cursor, which should be displayed `FLASH`ing or in 
`INVERSE`, respectively, for the editor cursor and the line cursor. Device drivers thus have great freedom in how 
they display these cursors. The line cursor is only displayed in automatic listing, explicit `LIST` and `LLIST` 
commands do not display it. The default `S` channel driver displays the line cursor in inverse, as can be seen in the 
mock screenshots of the manual. Alternative device drivers can highlight the entire program line, for example. 
Similarly, the editor cursor is now displayed through the output service routine and can thus be changed by the `K` 
channel driver.

The tabulator control `CHR$ 6` also delimits `INPUT` values in addition to the newline `CHR$ 13`. This way, comma 
separated outputs in `PRINT` or `LPRINT` can be read into individual variables by `INPUT` as originally intended.

Hitting `DELETE` with the cursor after attribute control sequences deletes the whole sequence.

### Graphics

`CLS` resets the `S` channel via `IOCTL 0`.

High resolution graphics commands `PLOT`, `DRAW` and `CIRCLE` are also routed through the `S` channel's output service 
routine as follows:

Attribute changes are sent into the channel as control sequences, with the carry flag set.

`PLOT` calls `IOCTL 2`, that is the output service routine with the **carry flag cleared** and register `A` holding the 
value 2. The two coordinates are on the calculator stack.

`DRAW` with two arguments calls `IOCTL 3`, `DRAW` with three arguments calls `IOCTL 4` with the arguments on the calculator 
stack.

`CIRCLE` calls `IOCTL 5` with the three arguments on the calculator stack. The circle-drawing algorithm has also been 
changed to a faster and more accurate one.

## The BASIC Interpreter

The BASIC interpreter in the ZX Spectrum traces its lineage to the ZX80. Most of it has been inherited directly from 
the ZX81. According to both of its authors, John Grant and Steve Vickers, some solutions adequate for machines with 1 
or 2 kilobytes of RAM were no longer adequate for a machine with 16 or 48 kilobytes of RAM, but were left in there 
nonetheless due to time pressure from Sinclair.

One such solution is program line lookup by sequential scanning from the beginning of the program. This is especially 
damaging because of the design decision to store all jump destinations into the BASIC program as a line number and 
statement number, which allows for `CONTINUE` even after modifications of the program; an otherwise commendable 
convenience of Sinclair BASIC. Thus, `GO TO`, `GO SUB`, `RUN`, `RETURN`, `NEXT` and `CONTINUE` all search through 
every line of the program from the beginning to their destination. For programs with hundreds or thousands of lines, 
this causes major slowdowns. This ROM implements binary search guaranteeing that program lines will be found in at 
most 12 iterations. The required line index takes 2 extra bytes per program line and 2 additional bytes for its own 
length. It is located between the command line's terminating `$0D` and the `$80` (changed to `$81` to indicate the 
presence of the index) separating it from the workspace. It is discarded immediately upon returning to BASIC editor and 
created lazily upon the first attempt to use it. In its absence, the system falls back to sequential scanning. This way, 
maximum compatibility is achieved with the ROM with which the ZX Spectrum ended up shipping.

## The Calculator Subsystem

This subsystem in the ZX Spectrum consists of two major parts: the expression scanner mostly inherited from the ZX80 
(written by John Grant) and the calculator VM mostly inherited from the ZX81 (written by Steve Vickers). Both are very 
mature, well written and optimized pieces of software, but the actual subroutines they call for implementing the opcodes 
of the VM and the operations in expressions are less then optimal in ROM with which the ZX Spectrum ended up shipping. 

There are typically three kinds of problems that this ROM fixes:
 1. Some operations (typically those new to the ZX Spectrum, not present in ZX 81) contain bugs that affect some corner 
    cases not tested before the ZX Spectrum's launch.
 2. Some code inherited from the ZX81 has been very aggressively optimized for brevity at the expense of performance to 
    fit into the 8k ROM of the ZX81. The Spectrum does not face that constraint, so performance can be substantially 
    improved.
 3. Minor calculator bugs (typically resulting in loss of 1 significant bit of precision) inherited from the ZX81.

### Arithmetics

While the ZX80 does all arithmetics in integers and the ZX81 does all arithmetics in floating-point, the ZX Spectrum can do 
both, switching between them entirely transparently for the user. This is a major innovation both in comparison to these 
earlier versions of Sinclair BASIC and in comparison to Microsoft BASIC, which requires the programmer to declare the 
type of each variable to be integer or floating point. The key insight of Steve Vickers is that in an interpreted language, 
checking the type of the variable causes exactly as much overhead as checking the type of the value. Unfortunately, this 
innovative mechanism mis-handles the corner case of `-65536` in two instances: addition and truncation. This ROM fixes both 
by unambiguously treating this number in floating point form as the rest of the calculator does. Try `PRINT -65000-536` 
and `PRINT INT -65536` to see the problem with the original ROM.

Decimal to floating point conversion contains an inaccuracy inherited from the ZX81, fixed in this ROM. Try `PRINT 1/2=0.5` 
to see the problem with the original ROM.

Binary literals with the `BIN` keyword (a novelty in the ZX Spectrum's expression scanner) impose constraints in the original 
ROM that are not mentioned in the manual: the maximum number of digits is 16 and only integer numbers are accepted. These 
constraints have been removed in this ROM by unifying the processing pipelines for decimal and binary literals. You can 
write one half as `BIN 0.1` in this ROM and express 32-bit integers in binary.

Another inaccuracy inherited from the ZX81 fixed in this ROM affects division. Try `PRINT (1/61)*61=1`.

The random number generator using integer arithmetics in ZX80 has been converted to floating point in the ZX81 which slows 
it down considerably. The ZX Spectrum inherited the ZX81 version for no good reason. This ROM uses integer `RND`, which 
behaves exactly the same as the one in the original ROM, except being much-much faster.

Powers (accessible through the `↑` operator) and square root (`SQR`) have been subject to aggressive optimization for 
brevity in ZX81, affecting both accuracy and speed. The ZX81-inherited routines have been changed to more performant 
and more accurate versions in this ROM.

The frequently used constant table in both the ZX81 and the ZX Spectrum's original ROM are stored in compressed format 
which is quite surprising, given that its size together with the uncompression routine is larger than just storing these 
constants without compression, which also speeds up quite a few operations. This is exactly what this ROM does.

Stack-handing errors affecting `STR$` and `SCREEN$` operators have been fixed. Try `PRINT "2"+STR$ 0.5` and 
`PRINT "error"=SCREEN$ (0,0)` with the original ROM to see the fixed errors in action.

### User-Defined Functions

User defined functions through `DEF FN` instructions and the `FN` keyword in expressions is an improvement over the ZX81, 
which required storing user defined functions in string variables and evaluating them with `VAL` or `VAL$`, because it 
allows argument variables to be local to the function. It is also substantially faster due to moving syntax checking 
and numeric literal interpreting from run time to edit time.

However, the actual implementation in the ROM is barely usable, because of how it implemented local variables. The manual 
mentions that recursive functions are prohibited, but this implementation also prohibits composition with the same function; 
a constraint not mentioned in the manual and therefore considered a bug. If you enter `10 DEF FN a(a,b)=a+b` that is 
supposed to define `FN a` as addition, `PRINT FN a(2,FN a(1,1))` will output `3` with the original ROM, even though 
`2+(1+1)=4`. This ROM fixes this problem. Not in the most optimal manner, but to maintain compatibility with software 
written for the original ROM. The lack of tail calls and conditional evaluation (except by ZX81-style trickery with 
`VAL` or `VAL$`) leave the manual's advice against recursive functions reasonable.
