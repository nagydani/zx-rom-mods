# ZX82 Replacement ROM for ZX Spectrum

## Introduction

In 1982, the ROM program with which the ZX Spectrum (both the 16k and the 48k versions) shipped was a proof-of-concept 
prototype, meant to be replaced as soon as the final version was ready. Alas, for various reasons it never happened.
Several subsystems in the ROM remained unfinished and quite a few bugs remained together with legacy solutions from ZX81 
which were planned to be upgraded for the more powerful machine.

This ROM attempts to be what the ZX Spectrum's final ROM could have been, should it have been finished. The Manual written 
by dr. Steve Vickers served as its primary specification. Both authors of the original ROM, dr. Steve Vickers and John Grant 
have been interviewed by email in the course of its creation. As much as possible, compatibility with existing ZX Spectrum 
software and hardware has been maintained by preserving important entry points. If you find some software or hardware that 
is not compatible with this ROM, please file an issue. I cannot promise to resolve it, but it will be certainly considered.

In addition to fixing bugs or finishing unfinished subsystems, this ROM also contains a few changes aiming at extensibility. 
These changes have been made in such a way as to not degrade performance compared with the ROM with which the ZX Spectrum 
shipped, mainly providing alternative execution paths upon error conditions.

This document describes all changes made to the ROM and is aimed at both users and developers.
