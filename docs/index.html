<p><em>Yet to be written</em></p>

<h2><a id="console" />Meet the Console</h2>

<p>The <em>console</em> is how wizards talk to computers, in their own 
language. Unlike the <em>desktop</em>, which is what muggles use to get 
the computer do what they need, the console allows you, in principle, to 
make the computer do <em>anything</em> that the computer is capable of 
doing at all. It might seem less fancy, but it is far more powerful and 
expressive than the desktop. Different computers might speak different 
languages on their console, but they are, in many ways, similar. </p>

<p>The language your ZX2020 understands is called <code>BASIC</code>, 
which stands for
<strong>B</strong>eginner's 
<strong>A</strong>ll-purpose
<strong>S</strong>ymbolic 
<strong>I</strong>nstruction
<strong>C</strong>ode.

There are many dialects of BASIC; ours is an evolution of <em>ZX 
BASIC</em>, developed for Sinclair's ZX line of computers in the early 
1980's. In particular, it is to a large extent backwards compatible 
with that of the <em>ZX Spectrum</em>, upon which ZX2020 is based.</p>

<p>When you turn on your ZX2020, it performs a quick self-test and greets
you with the following message near the bottom of the screen:
<pre>

</pre>
</p>

<p>You are using the console now. It is, essentially a dialog with the 
computer, similar to instant messaging. You type something, hit the 
ENTER key and the computer responds. ENTER is just about the most 
important key on the keyboard. Just pressing it means, &quot;Okay computer, 
I've typed in your orders. Now go and obey them.&quot;</p>
 
<p>As you start typing, you can immediately notice that the screen 
is divided into two parts by a black stripe with a rainbow: </p>
<img src="stripe.png" alt="BASIC:1 L ////" height="16" width="512"/>

<p>In fact, the part <em>below</em> the stripe is the console, the part 
<em>above</em> it is the <em>canvas</em>. Inside the stripe, you find 
the following information: <code>BASIC</code> stands for the kind of 
input the console expects from you. In this case, it expects a sequence 
of </em>statements</em> in BASIC. Then you have <code>:1</code>, which 
just indicates that you are about to type the <em>first</em> statement. 
Near the middle of the stripe, you see an <code>L</code> character, 
which is the current <em>input mode</em>. It tells you that if you press 
a letter key, it will produce a <em>lower-case</em> letter (try it!).
The rest is just decoration.</p>

<p>The blinking square is the so-called <em>cursor</em> which shows you 
where what you type is going to appear. If you have already typed in 
anything, you can move the cursor using the arrow keys. You can also 
delete what is before the cursor (which is normally what you have typed 
last) by hitting the DELETE key.</p>

<p>If you press CAPS LOCK, the mode changes to <code>C</code> which 
stands for <em>capital-case</em> letters (try!). You can change back to 
<code>L</code> mode by hitting CAPS LOCK again. You can also type 
capital-case letters in <code>L</code> mode by pressing and holding the 
SHIFT key <em>before</em> hitting the letter key. The SHIFT key needs to 
be pressed while you are hitting the letter key in order for it to 
produce a capital letter. If you keep any key pressed long enough, it 
will repeat its function. To type the symbols on either number or letter 
keys, you should press the SYM key (also called <em>Symbol Shift</em>) 
similarly to how you type capital-case letters with SHIFT.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> On many <em>other</em> computers, the symbols 
on number keys are typed with the SHIFT key, while the symbols on letter 
keys are typed with some other shift-like key (typically ALT GR). 
<strong><em>Not on a ZX!</em></strong> Here, all symbols are 
consistently typed with Symbol Shift, while SHIFT'ed numbers are 
performing the functions of control keys (for example, SHIFT+1 is the 
same as EDIT, which will undo everything you have typed so far). Be 
careful with those.</p>

<p>Now you know enough to start chatting with the ZX2020.</p>


<h2><a id="basics"/>The Basics of BASIC</h2>

<p>If you try to greet the computer by typing <code>Hello ZX!</code> and 
hitting ENTER, the cursor will jump to after the first letter. This is 
the computer's tactful way of telling you it does not understand a word 
you're saying. In fact, the cursor is moved to after the first character 
that the computer did not understand; the very first one, in this case.</p>
 
<p>Any valid statement in ZX BASIC must begin with a so-called 
<em>instruction keyword</em>. They are, in alphabetical order, the 
following:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>

</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you type <code>Draw.</code> and hit ENTER, you will notice that 
all the letters of the word <code>DRAW</code> are turned to capitals, an 
extra space is inserted before the period and the cursor is flashing 
after the period. The computer does still not understand what this is 
supposed to mean, though it understands a bit more than last time. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even though the keywords of BASIC are mostly 
English words, <em>BASIC is not English</em>. For the computer to 
understand what you type, it needs to be correct BASIC, not correct 
English. For instance, in BASIC, you do not end statements with a 
period.</p>

<p>If you move the cursor around, the computer won't let you move it 
inside the (now capitalized) keyword anymore; it jumps from one side, to 
the other. That is because it has recognized the keyword and now treats 
it as a single unit, a so-called <em>token</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> Statements instructing the computer to 
answer us in writing begin with the <code>PRINT</code> keyword. The 
reason for this is historical: computers got consoles before they became 
able to display anything on screens. In those days, the console's output 
was a roll of paper on which things were literally PRINTed. While this 
has no longer been the case for many decades now, the keyword stuck.</p>

<p>So let's try this: type <code>PRINT 2+2</code> and hit ENTER. The 
computer dutifully writes <code>4</code> on the canvas and reports
<pre>
0 OK, 0:1
</pre>
on the console. Note, that we get the same result no matter which letters 
are capitalized in the <code>PRINT</code> keyword; <code>pRiNt 2+2</code> 
would work just the same.</p>

<p>What happened here? The <code>4</code> is, as you might have guessed, 
the <em>evaluation</em> of <code>2+2</code>. <code>OK</code> means what 
you'd think it means: that there was no error in <em>executing</em> this 
statement. The <code>0:1</code> after the comma tells us that this was 
the first statement (<code>:1</code>, same as in the black stripe) of a 
sequence entered from the console. The very first <code>0</code> in the 
report is the <em>report code</em> identifiying the report. 
<code>0</code> stands for <code>OK</code>. While we need to talk to the 
ZX2020 in BASIC, it reports to us in English. However, it can be changed 
to report in other human languages as well, in which case the text of 
the report might change to the point of unintelligibility for those who 
do not know that particular language, but the report code remains the 
same, no matter what the langauge of the report is. Thus, one can 
understand what the report says even without understanding the language 
in which the computer is reporting, given a full list of error codes. If 
the computer needs to read its own or another computer's reports, it 
can just look at the report code, ignoring the text in a language which
it does not understand (such as English).</p>

<p>So, now we can use the computer as a calculator. But if we type 
<code>PRINT Hello</code> and hit ENTER, instead of a greeting on the 
canvas, we get an error report:</p>
<pre>
2 Variable not found, 0:1
</pre>

<p>This is because <code>Hello</code> is treated as a <em>name</em> of a 
<em>variable</em> (more on this a bit later), not as a text to print. If 
we mean a specific text, in BASIC, we must put it inside double quotes. 
<code>PRINT &quot;Hello&quot;</code> actually does write 
<code>Hello</code> on the canvas.</p>

<p>Instructions given on the console are called <em>commands</em>.  
However, one can also assemble sequences of instructions, which are 
called <em>programs</em> and execute them together. Type

<pre>
1 PRINT "Hello World!"
</pre>

in the console and hit ENTER. Instead of just writing <code>Hello 
World!</code> on the canvas, the entire command gets &quot;moved&quot; up 
to the canvas. Something very important has happened: you have just written 
your first computer program. Congratulations!</p>

<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> ZX BASIC is a programming language in which 
the instructions for programs and the instructions for commands are 
exactly the same. Such languages are called <em>scripting 
languages</em>, because programs are like scripted commands.</p>

<p>To <em>run</em> the program, just type the <code>RUN</code> command. 
It does write <code>Hello World!</code> on the canvas, just like in the 
previous example, but the report is slightly different:</p>
<pre>
0 OK, 1:1
</pre>

<p>The difference is the statement identifier. It says <code>1:1</code> 
now instead of <code>0:1</code>. This is because the last statement 
executed was not directly from the console, but from <em>program 
line</em> 1. You can enter another program line, too:</p>

<pre>
2 PRINT "My name is ZX2020."
</pre>

<p>When you ENTER this program line, it also moves up and you see this in 
the canvas area:</p>
<pre>
   1 PRINT "Hello World!"
   2&gt;PRINT "My name is ZX2020."
</pre>

<p>That little <code>&gt</code> sign after line number <code>2</code> is 
the so-called <em>program cursor</em>. You can move it up and down with 
the arrow keys and bring the pointed program line back down to the console 
by pressing the EDIT key for further EDITing. Now try giving your ZX2020 a
personal name by EDITing line 2. If you wish to delete a program line, just
enter its number without any instructions. Thus, for example, entering 
<code>1</code> would remove the greeting from before the self-introduction.</p>

<p>In order to make it easier to insert new program lines in between 
existing ones, there is a convention to number program lines by the 
multiples of 10. The command <code>RENUM</code> re-numbers the program 
to follow this convention.</p>

<h2><a id="first"/>Guess the Number</h2>

<pre>
  10 LET number=1+INT (1000*RND)
  20 LET guesses=0
  30 REPEAT
  40 INPUT "Your guess?",guess
  50 IF guess&lt;number THEN PRINT guess;" is too low."
  60 IF guess&gt;number THEN PRINT guess;" is too high."
  70 LET guesses+=1
  80 UNTIL guess=number
  90 PRINT "Congratulations, you guessed ";number;"."
 100 PRINT "It took you ";guesses;" guesses."
</pre>
