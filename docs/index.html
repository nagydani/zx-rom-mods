<h2><a id="intro" />Introduction</h2>

<p><em>Yet to be written</em></p>

<h2><a id="console" />Meet the Console</h2>

<p>The <em>console</em> is how wizards talk to computers, in their own 
language. Unlike the <em>desktop</em>, which is what muggles use to get 
the computer do what they need, the console allows you, in principle, to 
make the computer do <em>anything</em> that the computer is capable of 
doing at all. It might seem less fancy, but it is far more powerful and 
expressive than the desktop. Different computers might speak different 
languages on their console, but they are, in many ways, similar. </p>

<p>The language your ZX2020 understands is called <code>BASIC</code>, 
which stands for
<strong>B</strong>eginner's 
<strong>A</strong>ll-purpose
<strong>S</strong>ymbolic 
<strong>I</strong>nstruction
<strong>C</strong>ode.

There are many dialects of BASIC; ours is an evolution of <em>ZX 
BASIC</em>, developed for Sinclair's ZX line of computers in the early 
1980's. In particular, it is to a large extent backwards compatible 
with that of the <em>ZX Spectrum</em>, upon which ZX2020 is based.</p>

<p>When you turn on your ZX2020, it performs a quick self-test and greets
you with the following message near the bottom of the screen:

</pre>
</p>

<p>You are using the console now. It is, essentially a dialog with the 
computer, similar to instant messaging. You type something, hit the 
ENTER key and the computer responds. ENTER is just about the most 
important key on the keyboard. Just pressing it means, &quot;Okay computer, 
I've typed in your orders. Now go and obey them.&quot;</p>
 
<p>As you start typing, you can immediately notice that the screen 
is divided into two parts by a black stripe with a rainbow: </p>
<img src="stripe.png" alt="BASIC:1 L ////" height="16" width="512"/>

<p>In fact, the part <em>below</em> the stripe is the console, the part 
<em>above</em> it is the <em>canvas</em>. Inside the stripe, you find 
the following information: <code>BASIC</code> stands for the kind of 
input the console expects from you. In this case, it expects a sequence 
of </em>statements</em> in BASIC. Then you have <code>:1</code>, which 
just indicates that you are about to type the <em>first</em> statement. 
Near the middle of the stripe, you see an <code>L</code> character, 
which is the current <em>input mode</em>. It tells you that if you press 
a letter key, it will produce a <em>lower-case</em> letter (try it!).
The rest is just decoration.</p>

<p>If you press CAPS LOCK, the mode changes to <code>C</code> which 
stands for <em>capital-case</em> letters (try!). You can also type 
capital-case letters in <code>L</code> mode by pressing and holding the 
SHIFT key <em>before</em> hitting the letter key. Release SHIFT 
<em>after</em> you have released the letter key. If you keep any key 
pressed long enough, it will repeat its function. To type the symbols on 
either number or letter keys, you should press the SYM key (also called 
<em>Symbol Shift</em>) similarly to how you type capital-case letters 
with SHIFT.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> On many <em>other</em> computers, the symbols 
on number keys are typed with the SHIFT key, while the symbols on letter 
keys are typed with some other shift-like key (typically ALT GR). 
<strong><em>Not on a ZX!</em></strong> Here, all symbols are 
consistently typed with Symbol Shift, while SHIFT'ed numbers are 
performing the functions of control keys (for example, SHIFT+1 is the 
same as EDIT, which will undo everything you have typed so far). Be 
careful with those.</p>

<p>The blinking square is the so-called <em>cursor</em> which shows you 
where what you type is going to appear. You can move the cursor by the 
arrow keys. You can also delete what is before the cursor (which is 
normally what you have typed last) by hitting the DELETE key. Now you 
know enough to start talking to the ZX2020.</p>


<h2><a id="basics"/>The Basics of BASIC</h2>

<p>If you try to greet the computer by typing <code>Hello ZX!</code> and 
hitting ENTER, the cursor will jump to after the first letter. This is 
the computer's tactful way of telling you it does not understand a word 
you're saying. In fact, the cursor is moved to after the first character 
that the computer did not understand; the very first one, in this case.</p>
 
<p>Any valid statement in ZX BASIC must begin with a so-called 
<em>instruction keyword</em>. They are, in alphabetical order, the 
following:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
BEEP
BORDER

CAT
CIRCLE
CLEAR
CLOSE #
CLS

COPY

REM
RENUM
REPEAT
RESTORE
RETURN
RUN
SAVE

STOP

USR
VERIFY




</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you type <code>Draw.</code> and hit ENTER, you will notice that 
all the letters of the word <code>DRAW</code> are turned to capitals, an 
extra space is inserted before the period and the cursor is flashing 
after the period. The computer does still not understand what this is 
supposed to mean, though it understands a bit more than last time. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even though the keywords of BASIC are English 
words, <em>BASIC is not English</em>.</p>

<h2><a id="first"/>Guess the Number</h2>

<pre>
  10 LET number=1+INT (1000*RND)
  20 LET guesses=0
  30 REPEAT
  40 INPUT "Your guess?",guess
  50 IF guess&lt;number THEN PRINT guess;" is too low."
  60 IF guess&gt;number THEN PRINT guess;" is too high."
  70 LET guesses+=1
  80 UNTIL guess=number
  90 PRINT "Congratulations, you guessed ";number;"."
 100 PRINT "It took you ";guesses;" guesses."
</pre>
