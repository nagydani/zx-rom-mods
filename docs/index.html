<h2><a id="intro" />Introduction</h2>

<p><em>Yet to be written</em></p>

<h2><a id="console" />Meet the Console</h2>

<p>The <em>console</em> is how wizards talk to computers, in their own 
language. Unlike the <em>desktop</em>, which is what muggles use to get 
the computer do what they need, the console allows you, in principle, to 
make the computer do <em>anything</em> that the computer is capable of 
doing at all. It might seem less fancy, but it is far more powerful and 
expressive than the desktop. Different computers might speak different 
languages on their console, but they are, in many ways, similar. </p>

<p>The language your ZX85 understands is called <code>BASIC</code>, 
which stands for
<strong>B</strong>eginner's 
<strong>A</strong>ll-purpose
<strong>S</strong>ymbolic 
<strong>I</strong>nstruction
<strong>C</strong>ode.

There are many dialects of BASIC; ours is an evolution of <em>ZX 
BASIC</em>, developed for Sinclair's ZX line of computers in the early 
1980's. In particular, it is to a large extent backwards compatible 
with that of the <em>ZX Spectrum</em>, upon which ZX85 is based.</p>

<p>When you turn on your ZX85, it performs a quick self-test and greets
you with the following message near the bottom of the screen:
<pre>

© 1982 Sinclair Research Ltd
</pre>
</p>

<p>You are using the console now. It is, essentially a dialog with the 
computer, similar to instant messaging. You type something, hit the 
ENTER key and the computer responds. ENTER is just about the most 
important key on the keyboard. Just pressing it means, &quot;Okay computer, 
I've typed in your orders. Now go and obey them.&quot;</p>
 
<p>As you start typing, you can immediately notice that the screen 
is divided into two parts by a black stripe with a rainbow: </p>
<img src="stripe.png" alt="BASIC:1 L ////" height="16" width="512"/>

<p>In fact, the part <em>below</em> the stripe is the console, the part 
<em>above</em> it is the <em>canvas</em>. Inside the stripe, you find 
the following information: <code>BASIC</code> stands for the kind of 
input the console expects from you. In this case, it expects a sequence 
of </em>statements</em> in BASIC. Then you have <code>:1</code>, which 
just indicates that you are about to type the <em>first</em> statement. 
Near the middle of the stripe, you see an <code>L</code> character, 
which is the current <em>input mode</em>. It tells you that if you press 
a letter key, it will produce a <em>lower-case</em> letter (try it!).
The rest is just decoration.</p>

<p>The blinking square is the so-called <em>cursor</em> which shows you 
where what you type is going to appear. If you have already typed in 
anything, you can move the cursor using the arrow keys. You can also 
delete what is before the cursor (which is normally what you have typed 
last) by hitting the DELETE key.</p>

<p>If you press CAPS LOCK, the mode changes to <code>C</code> which 
stands for <em>capital-case</em> letters (try!). You can change back to 
<code>L</code> mode by hitting CAPS LOCK again. You can also type 
capital-case letters in <code>L</code> mode by pressing and holding the 
SHIFT key <em>before</em> hitting the letter key. The SHIFT key needs to 
be pressed while you are hitting the letter key in order for it to 
produce a capital letter. If you keep any key pressed long enough, it 
will repeat its function. To type the symbols on either number or letter 
keys, you should press the SYM key (also called <em>Symbol Shift</em>) 
similarly to how you type capital-case letters with SHIFT.</p>

<div class="frame">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On many <em>other</em> computers, the symbols 
on number keys are typed with the SHIFT key, while the symbols on letter 
keys are typed with some other shift-like key (typically ALT GR). 
<strong><em>Not on a ZX!</em></strong> Here, all symbols are 
consistently typed with Symbol Shift, while SHIFT'ed numbers are 
performing the functions of control keys (for example, SHIFT+1 is the 
same as EDIT, which will undo everything you have typed so far). Be 
careful with those.</p>
</div>

<p>Now you know enough to start chatting with the ZX85.</p>


<h2><a id="basics"/>The Basics of BASIC</h2>

<p>If you try to greet the computer by typing <code>Hello ZX!</code> and 
hitting ENTER, the cursor will jump to after the first letter. This is 
the computer's tactful way of telling you it does not understand a word 
you're saying. In fact, the cursor is moved to after the first character 
that the computer did not understand; the very first one, in this case.</p>
 
<p>Any valid statement in ZX BASIC must begin with a so-called 
<em>instruction keyword</em>. They are, in alphabetical order, the 
following:</p>
<table>
<tr>

</table>

<p>If you type <code>Draw.</code> and hit ENTER, you will notice that as 
soon as you type the period, all the letters of the word 
<code>DRAW</code> are turned to capitals, an extra space is inserted 
before the period and the cursor is flashing after the period. The 
computer does still not understand what this is supposed to mean, though 
it understands a bit more than last time.</p>

<div class="frame">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even though the keywords of BASIC are mostly 
English words, <em>BASIC is not English</em>. For the computer to 
understand what you type, it needs to be correct BASIC, not correct 
English. For instance, in BASIC, you do not end statements with a 
period.</p>
</div>

<p>If you move the cursor around, the computer won't let you move it 
inside the (now capitalized) keyword anymore; it jumps from one side, to 
the other. That is because it has recognized the keyword and now treats 
it as a single unit, a so-called <em>token</em>.</p>

<div class="frame">
<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> Statements instructing the 
computer to answer us in writing begin with the <code>PRINT</code> 
keyword. The reason for this is historical: computers got consoles 
before they became able to display anything on screens. In those days, 
the console's output was a roll of paper on which things were literally 
PRINTed. While this has no longer been the case for many decades now, 
the keyword stuck.</p>

<div class=figure>
<img src="https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/kemenyteaches1.jpg"
width="600px" height="448px" alt="John Kemeny teaches BASIC">
<figcaption>John Kemeny, the inventor of BASIC teaches it to students at
Dartmouth College back when consoles were teletype machines and Dartmouth
was not yet a co-ed institution.</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

<p>So let's try this: type <code>PRINT 2+2</code> and hit ENTER. The 
computer dutifully writes <code>4</code> on the canvas and reports
<pre>
0 OK, 0:1
</pre>
on the console. Note, that we get the same result no matter which letters 
are capitalized in the <code>PRINT</code> keyword; <code>pRiNt 2+2</code> 
would work just the same.</p>

<p>What happened here? The <code>4</code> is, as you might have guessed, 
the <em>evaluation</em> of <code>2+2</code>. <code>OK</code> means what 
you'd think it means: that there was no error in <em>executing</em> this 
statement. The <code>0:1</code> after the comma tells us that this was 
the first statement (<code>:1</code>, same as in the black stripe) of a 
sequence entered from the console. The very first <code>0</code> in the 
report is the <em>report code</em> identifiying the report. 
<code>0</code> stands for <code>OK</code>. While we need to talk to the 
ZX85 in BASIC, it reports to us in English. However, it can be changed 
to report in other human languages as well, in which case the text of 
the report might change to the point of unintelligibility for those who 
do not know that particular language, but the report code remains the 
same, no matter what the langauge of the report is. Thus, one can 
understand what the report says even without understanding the language 
in which the computer is reporting, given a full list of error codes. If 
the computer needs to read its own or another computer's reports, it 
can just look at the report code, ignoring the text in a language which
it does not understand (such as English).</p>

<p>So, now you can use the computer as a calculator. But if you type 
<code>PRINT Hello</code> and hit ENTER, instead of a greeting on the 
canvas, we get an error report:</p>
<pre>
2 Variable not found, 0:1
</pre>

<p>This is because <code>Hello</code> is treated as a <em>name</em> of a 
<em>variable</em> (more on this a bit later), not as a text to print. If 
we mean a specific text, in BASIC, we must put it inside double quotes. 
<code>PRINT &quot;Hello&quot;</code> actually does write 
<code>Hello</code> on the canvas.</p>

<div class="frame">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Computers are very fussy that you should 
distinguish between the digit zero and the letter O. To make it 
absolutely clear, zero appears on the screen as <code>0</code>, with a 
slash through it. You also need to distinguish between the digit one 
(<code>1</code>), the capital letter i (<code>I</code>) and the small 
letter L (<code>l</code>). All ten digits are on the top row of the 
keyboard. Furthermore, you must use the star (<code>*</code>) for 
multiplication, <em>not</em> the letter x.</p>
</div>

<p>Instructions given on the console are called <em>commands</em>.  
However, one can also assemble sequences of instructions, which are 
called <em>programs</em> and execute them together. Type

<pre>
1 PRINT "Hello World!"
</pre>

in the console and hit ENTER. Instead of just writing <code>Hello 
World!</code> on the canvas, the entire command gets &quot;moved&quot; up 
to the canvas. Something very important has happened: you have just written 
your first computer program. Congratulations!</p>

<div class="frame">
<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> ZX BASIC is a programming language in which 
the instructions for programs and the instructions for commands are 
exactly the same. Such languages are called <em>scripting 
languages</em>, because programs are like scripted commands.</p>
</div>

<p>To <em>run</em> the program, just type the <code>RUN</code> command. 
It does write <code>Hello World!</code> on the canvas, just like in the 
previous example, but the report is slightly different:</p>
<pre>
0 OK, 1:1
</pre>

<p>The difference is the statement identifier. It says <code>1:1</code> 
now instead of <code>0:1</code>. This is because the last statement 
executed was not directly from the console, but from <em>program 
line</em> 1. You can enter another program line, too:</p>

<pre>
2 PRINT "My name is ZX85."
</pre>

<p>When you ENTER this program line, it also moves up and you see this in 
the canvas area:</p>
<pre>
   1 PRINT "Hello World!"
   2&gt;PRINT "My name is ZX85."
</pre>

<p>That little <code>&gt</code> sign after line number <code>2</code> is 
the so-called <em>program cursor</em>. You can move it up and down with 
the arrow keys and bring the pointed program line back down to the console 
by pressing the EDIT key for further EDITing. Now try giving your ZX85 a
personal name by EDITing line 2. If you wish to delete a program line, just
enter its number without any instructions. Thus, for example, entering 
<code>1</code> would remove the greeting from before the self-introduction.</p>

<p>In order to make it easier to insert new program lines in between 
existing ones, there is a convention to number program lines by the 
multiples of 10. The command <code>RENUM</code> re-numbers the program 
to follow this convention. After <code>RENUM</code>. the two-line program 
above becomes this:</p>

<pre>
  10 PRINT "Hello World!"
  20 PRINT "My name is ZX85."
</pre>

<p>Re-numbering does not change what the program does, at least for 
well-written programs, it just makes it easier to work on it.</p>

<p>Now you know enough to start programming your ZX85. In each of the 
following chapters, you find programs of increasingly complex computer 
games and explanations of how and why they work. You are encouraged to 
modify them, make them better and, eventually, write your own games</p>


<h2><a id="first"/>Guess the Number</h2>

<p>The following ten-line program is a simple number guessing game. 
The computer picks a random number between 1 and 1000 and you need to 
guess it. After each guess, the computer would tell you whether your 
guess was correct, too high or too low. Based on this information, you can 
close in on the number picked by the computer. Type in the following program 
and then enter the <code>RUN</code> command to play a game.</p>

<pre>
  10 LET number=1+INT (1000*RND)
  20 LET guesses=0
  30 REPEAT
  40  INPUT "Your guess?",guess
  50  IF guess&lt;number THEN PRINT guess;" is too low."
  60  IF guess&gt;number THEN PRINT guess;" is too high."
  70  LET guesses+=1
  80 UNTIL guess=number
  90 PRINT "Congratulations, you guessed ";number;"."
 100 PRINT "It took you ";guesses;" guesses."
</pre>

<p>When the game ends, the console shows the following report:
<pre>
0 OK, 100:1
</pre>
By now, you know what that means. You can always play another round by 
entering <code>RUN</code> again.</p>

<div class="frame">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the game asks you to guess a number, the 
separator stripe between the canvas and the console says 
<code>NUMERIC</code> instead of <code>BASIC</code> which means that it
expects a number or a <em>numeric expression</em>; a formula that, 
when evaluated, results in a number. So, if you type <code>100+200</code>, 
it qualifies as a guess of <code>300</code>. Try it!</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="frame">
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> This behavior actually allows the player 
to &quot;cheat&quot; and always guess the number picked by the computer 
correctly upon first attempt. Wizards that are good at noticing and 
exploiting such opportunities are called <em>hackers</em>. Can you think 
like a hacker and win the game in one guess every time?</p>
</div>

<p>Now, let's see what it actually does. In the first two lines 
(numbered <code>10</code> and <code>20</code>, respectively), the 
instruction keyword is <code>LET</code>. It <em>assigns</em> 
<em>values</em> to <em>variable names</em>. That is, it LETs the name 
mean a particular number, until further assignments. For example, in 
line <code>20</code>, the variable name <code>guesses</code> is made to 
stand for zero. You can try it separately. If you enter that line 
without the line number and then type <code>PRINT guesses</code> it will 
output <code>0</code>. If you enter <code>LET five=2+2</code> and then
<code>PRINT five</code>, it will output <code>4</code>. This is perfectly
<code>OK</code>, because <code>five</code> is just a name, and 
when a wizard uses a name, it means just what the wizard chooses it to 
mean &mdash; neither more nor less.</p>

<div class="frame">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In ZX BASIC, anywhere where you can enter a 
number, you can also enter numeric expressions. There is only one 
exception from this rule: the line number before statements. Thus 
<code>2+2 PRINT</code> is not correct BASIC, but anywhere else where 
<code>4</code> is accepted, <code>2+2</code> or <code>2*(1+1)</code> is 
also accepted and means the same.</p>
</div>

<p>Line <code>10</code> has two keywords that are not even on the list 
of the previous chapter: <code>INT</code> and <code>RND</code>. This is 
because they are not instruction keywords. BASIC statements cannot begin 
with those. Let's explore them in more detail!</p>

<p><code>RND</code> is similar to variables, except that it does 
not need to be assigned and changes its value all by itself. It means a
random number that is at least zero and always less than 1. If you enter
<code>PRINT RND</code>, it will output a different fractional number
every time. Once in a while, it will output <code>0</code>, though the 
chances of that happening are pretty slim: one to 65536. It will never
output <code>1</code>, though it can get pretty close.</p>

<p>Thus, <code>1000*RND</code> is a number that is at least zero and 
always less than 1000. Try <code>PRINT 1000*RND</code> a few times. Most 
of these numbers have a fractional part after a decimal point. This is 
what <code>INT</code> removes. <code>INT</code> is a <em>function</em> 
that does something to the number that follows it. In particular, it 
turns it into an <em>integer</em> (which is just wizard-speak for whole 
numbers), removing the fractional part of numbers greater than zero.</p>
 
<p>However, <code>PRINT INT 1000*RND</code> does exactly the same as 
<code>PRINT 1000*RND</code> (try!). This is because the number that 
follows <code>INT</code> is <code>1000</code> so it takes the whole part 
of 1000, which is still 1000. Only then is it multiplied by 
<code>RND</code>. Similarly, <code>INT RND * 1000</code> is still not 
what we want (try it!), because the number following <code>INT</code> in 
this case is <code>RND</code>. Since <code>RND</code> has only a 
fractional part, <code>INT RND</code> is always zero. If you multiply 
that by 1000, it is still zero.</p>

<p>To exactly determine the order of operations, you need to use 
<code>(</code> and <code>)</code>, the so-called <em>parentheses</em>. 
What is between these is evaluated before what is outside of them. 
Hence, <code>INT (1000*RND)</code>. This results in a random whole number 
that is at least zero and less than 1000, that is at most 999. But since 
we want a random number between 1 and 1000, 1 needs to be added to it.
Actually, <code>INT (RND*1000)+1</code> would work just the same. This is 
because the results of multiplication and addition do not change if 
we switch the order of the numbers to multiply or to add. Wizards call 
such operations <em>commutative</em>.</p>

<p>Line <code>30</code> contains a single keyword <code>REPEAT</code>. 
It means that what follows until the keyword <code>UNTIL</code> (see 
line <code>80</code>) must be repeated. It must be repeated 
UNTIL the condition following that keyword becomes true. 
In our case, until the player's <code>guess</code> and the <code>number</code> 
picked by the computer (in line <code>10</code>) become equal.</p>

<p>Now let's look to the four lines between <code>REPEAT</code> and 
<code>UNTIL</code>, which is what needs to be REPEATed.</p>

<p>Line <code>40</code> begins with the keyword <code>INPUT</code>. Its 
purpose is somewhat similar to that of <code>LET</code> in that it 
assigns values to variables, but, unlike <code>LET</code>, it reads the 
value from the console. The keyword <code>INPUT</code> is followed by a 
list consisting of things to write to the console and variable names 
which are to be assigned the values read from the console. These can be 
separated by comma (<code>,</code>, SYM+N), semicolon (<code>;</code>, 
SYM+O), or apostrophe (<code>'</code>, SYM+7). The difference is where 
the next item is going to appear on the console: in case of a comma, it 
is going to be neatly tabulated to either the middle of the line, or, if 
there is no space for that, to the beginning of the next line, in case 
of a semicolon, it is going to appear right after the end of the 
previous item, while in case of an apostrophe, it is going to appear at 
the beginning of the next line. Try changing the separator between 
<code>"Your guess?"</code> and <code>guess</code> in line 
<code>40</code> to see all this in action.</p>

<p>Lines <code>50</code> and <code>60</code> begin with an 
<code>IF</code> keyword followed by a condition, a <code>THEN</code> 
keyword and a <code>PRINT</code> statement. Such program lines execute 
the part after <code>THEN</code> only IF the condition following 
<code>IF</code> holds true.</p>

<p>Line <code>70</code> contains an unusual <code>LET</code> statement, 
a so-called <em>update</em>. It is, essentially, a shorthand for
<code>LET guesses=guesses+1</code>. It requires less typing on the wizard's
part and less interpreting on the computer's part.</p>

<p>Line <code>80</code> closes the <em>loop</em> started in line 
<code>30</code>. It is called a loop, because if you draw 
little arrows from each statement to possible next statements, your 
arrows are going to form a loop; a sequence of statements to be 
(possibly) repeated.</p>

<div class="frame">
<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> Loops that read the console and depending on 
what has been entered print something are called <em>REPL</em> by 
wizards, which stands for 
<strong>R</strong>ead -
<strong>E</strong>valuate -
<strong>P</strong>rint -
<strong>L</strong>oop. If you think about it, ZX BASIC itself is a REPL.</p>
</div>

<p>Lines <code>90</code> and <code>100</code> are just regular 
<code>PRINT</code> statements. Just like in <code>INPUT</code> the 
separators between things to be printed determine how they are going to be
positioned relative to one another on the canvas.</p>

<p>How many attempts do you need to guess the number without cheating? 
Let's switch sides with the ZX85 now and write a program that plays this 
same game as the guesser: the player thinks of a number and the computer 
tries to guess it.</p>

<pre>
  10 PRINT "Think of a whole number between 1 and 1000."''
  20 LET low=0: LET high=1024
  30 REPEAT
  40  LET guess=(low+high)/2
  50  PRINT "Is it ";guess;"?",
  60  INPUT "0: Too high."'"1: Too low."'"2: Correct."'answer
  70  IF answer=0
  80   LET high=guess
  90   PRINT "0: Too high."
 100  ELSE IF answer=1
 110   LET low=guess
 120   PRINT "1: Too high."
 130  ELSE IF answer=2
 140   PRINT "2: It is ";guess;"."
 150   STOP
 160  ELSE
 170   PRINT "I do not understand ";answer;"."
 180  END IF
 190 UNTIL high-low<2
 200 PRINT "This cannot be."'low;" is too low, but ";high;" is too high."
</pre>

<p>You may have noted that the initial high number is 1024, rather than 1001.
The reason for this is to make sure that the division in line <code>40</code>
always results in a whole number, since
1024 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
that is two multiplied by itself ten times or, as wizards say:
&quot;two to the power of ten&quot;. It is written like 2<sup>10</sup>.
Thus, 1024 can be divided by 2 ten times, which is, not entirely by lucky 
coincidence, the maximum number of guesses the computer needs to guess a 
whole number between 1 and 1000.</p>

<p>The operation of multiplying a number by itself (or <em>taking 
powers</em> in wizard-speak) is denoted by the upwards-pointing arrow 
(<code>^</code>, SYM+H) in ZX BASIC. Try <code>PRINT 2^10</code>.
</p>

<p>Play this game a few times and note the sequences of answers you give 
to ZX85. It will always guess the number in no more than 10 questions and
for any given number, the sequence of questions and answers will be the
same. In fact, if you know that the number is somewhere between 1 and 1000,
the answers you give already uniquely identify the number. Now let us
modify the game a little bit. Change the following lines:</p>
<pre>
  50 PRINT "Is it at least ";guess;"?";TAB 22;
  60 INPUT "0: No, it is not."'"1: Yes, it is."'answer
  90 PRINT "0: No."
 120 PRINT "1: Yes."
 200 PRINT "The number is ";low;"."
</pre>
<p>Then delete lines <code>130</code> through <code>150</code>. You can
accomplish this by the command <code>DELETE 130 TO 150</code>. The new
keyword <code>TAB</code> in line <code>50</code> is similar to the 
comma, but it can tabulate to any position (22, in our case), not just
the middle of the line, which would be <code>TAB 16</code>.</p>

<p>Now you can <code>RUN</code> this &quot;new game&quot;. It is now more 
similar to <em>Twenty Questions</em> in that every question is answered 
by either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. However, the computer will
always guess the number in exactly 10 questions. For example, 500 would be
guessed like this:
<pre>
Is it at least 512?   0: No.
Is it at least 256?   1: Yes.
Is it at least 384?   1: Yes.
Is it at least 448?   1: Yes.
Is it at least 480?   1: Yes.
Is it at least 496?   1: Yes.
Is it at least 504?   0: No.
Is it at least 500?   1: Yes.
Is it at least 502?   0: No.
Is it at least 501?   0: No.
The number is 500.
</pre>
If you change
the <code>1000</code> in line <code>10</code> to <code>1000000</code>
(one <em>million</em>) and also <code>high</code> in line <code>20</code>
from <code>1024</code> to <code>2^20</code> it will ask 20 questions before 
guessing the number. Any integer up to a million in just 20 yes/no

<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> The strategy of picking the middle element in
some ordering, comparing it to what you are looking for and based on whether
or not it is greater, continuing either with the lower or the upper half
of the ordering is called <em>binary search</em> and it is the wizard's way
of quickly finding needles in haystacks. It is a simple, yet very powerful
strategy (or <em>algorithm</em> in wizard-speak) from a broader class of
<em>divide and conquer</em> algorithms. You are going to learn many of those
and maybe invent some of your own.
</p>
<p>Our word &quot;algorithm&quot; is honoring an outstanding medieval wizard,
<em>Muhammad al-Khwarizmi</em>, who invented or rigorously described several
algorithms that we regulary use to this day.</p>

<p>The answers in <em>this</em> game <em>do</em> uniquely identify the 
integer and you do not even need to know how large it can be, as that 
can be learned from the <em>number</em> of answers. It is called 
<em>binary representation</em> and this is how computers represent 
numbers internally. In ZX Basic, you can use this representation using 
the <code>BIN</code> keyword. For example, you can write <code>BIN 
0111110100</code> instead of <code>500</code>. Moreover, you can omit 
the leading zeroes, so <code>BIN 111110100</code> also means 500.</p>

<p>In general, <em>everything</em> is a sequence of zeroes 
and ones for the computer. Just like in the game above, it is common 
practice to represent &quot;yes&quot; by <code>1</code> and 
&quot;no&quot; by <code>0</code>. ZX85 actually does it all the time. 
For example, ask it whether two is less than one by typing <code>PRINT 
2&lt;1</code>. It will answer <code>0</code> by which it means 
&quot;No.&quot;. But to <code>PRINT 2&gt;1</code> or to 
<code>PRINT 2+2=4</code> it will answer <code>1</code> by which it means 
&quot;Yes.&quot;. Anywhere where you can write answers to yes/no questions,
you can also write numeric expressions, where those evaluating to zero
will be taken as a &quot;no&quot;, everything else as a &quot;yes&quot;.
For example, <code>IF 0 THEN PRINT "zero"</code> will not output anything,
but <code>IF 1 THEN PRINT "one"</code> will output <code>one</code> to
the canvas, and so will <code>IF 5 THEN PRINT "one"</code>.</p>

<p>Binary numbers are very important in wizardry, or as wizards call it, 
<em>computer science</em>. Those wishing to become wizards better learn 
to use them as second nature. For example, you should get into the habit 
of counting on your fingers in binary. Thus, instead of just 5, you will 
be able to count up to 31 on one hand (be careful with showing number 4 
to other people; muggles might misunderstand you). Each <em>digit</em> 
(which is just Latin for &quot;finger&quot;) in a binary number 
corresponds to a power of 2. Your thumb corresponds to 1 (which is 
2<sup>0</sup>), your index finger corresponds to 2 (2<sup>1</sup>), your 
middle finger to 4 (2<sup>2</sup>), your ring finger to 8 
(2<sup>3</sup>) and your pinky to 16 (2<sup>4</sup>). For example, if 
you want to show 7, you only extend your thumb, your index finger and 
your middle finger, becase 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 (try <code>PRINT BIN 
00111</code>). An extended thumb, index finger and pinky means 19 (which 
is 1 + 2 + 16, <code>BIN 10011</code>). In general, if you want to find 
out the binary representation of a number, you can either play the game 
above, or use another keyword, <code>STR$</code>. For example, 
<code>PRINT STR$ (30,2)</code> will be answered with <code>11110</code> 
(try it!), meaning all except your thumb extended. <code>STR$</code> is 
used to obtain various representations of numbers, with <code>2</code> 
meaning binary. The parentheses are needed, because otherwise 
<code>STR$</code> will only concern itself with <code>30</code>, the 
comma would mean tabulation to the middle of the line and <code>2</code> 
would mean 2. Try!</p>

<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> While all actual computers used today by 
humans are binary, it is not the only reasonable choice for digital 
computers. The reason humanity ended up using binary computers 
exclusively is that there are tremendous benefits in all computers being 
based on the same logic so that many things only need to be done once 
and used everywhere. The other reasonable choice for digital computers 
is <em>ternary</em>, which is based around the powers of 3 rather than 
two. The three kinds of digits there are -1, 0 and +1, meaning 
&quot;no&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;. Alien computers 
may very well be ternary. In fact, humanity has also explored ternary 
computing, an effort culminating in the serial production of a ternary 
computer named Setun' after a creek flowing through the campus of 
Lomonosov University in Moscow, Russia. But by the time the details were 
worked out to the point of practicality, binary computers were so 
widespread that it did not make much sense to continue. </p>

<p>However, this choice does not matter all that much. All digital 
computers can &quot;pretend to be&quot; (wizards say <em>emulate</em>) 
any other digital computer, so the (amazingly broad and to this day 
largely unexplored) set of problems that can be solved by digital 
computers does not depend on this choice. This universality (called 
<em>Turing-completeness</em> in his honor) was discovered and proven by an 
outstanding British wizard in the middle of the twentieth century, a 
pioneer of electronic computing, <em>Alan Turing</em>.</p>

<h2><a id="second"/>2048</h2>

<p>Now is the time to write the first game that is actually a lot of fun 
to play, to the point of being mildly addictive. The author readily 
admits to spending most of a twelve-hour trans-pacific flight playing 
this game on the onboard entertainment system. Playing this game will 
also help you memorize the powers of two. This game called 
<strong>2048</strong> was designed by an Italian wizard, Gabriele 
Cirulli in 2014.</p>
